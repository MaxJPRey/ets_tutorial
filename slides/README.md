The slides are in markdown files in this directory.

Install jupytext https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/) and RISE
(https://rise.readthedocs.io/) to view the slides.

Once those are installed, you can open up the markdown files just as you would
a jupyter notebook.  You may also convert the markdown to proper notebook files using

```
jupytext --to ipynb 01_intro.md
```

This will generate a `01_intro.ipynb` file.
